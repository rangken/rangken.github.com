Google introduced [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.html) as a part of the support library as the next-gen ListView. It's new, efficient and highly customisable, no wonder everyone wants to make the switch. This step-by-step guide will show you how to migrate from an existing ListView (or GridView / StaggeredGridView / ExpandableListView), replacing the implementation with a RecyclerView.

### RecyclerView vs. LayoutManager

The official documentation states that the RecyclerView is _a flexible view for providing a limited window into a large data set_. So the RecyclerView itself is only a container made to render items from an adapter, specifying the orientation and other properties of the children is up to the developer. This is where the [LayoutManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.LayoutManager.html) comes to play, this class is responsible for positioning and measuring the child views, and also for recycling them. Choosing the LayoutManager affects the behaviour of the RecyclerView - for example if you want to mimic a ListView, roll with a LinearLayoutManager.

Built-in LayoutManagers are provided for the basic use cases, but of course it is possible to implement a custom one. Each have two orientations, for vertical or horizontal scrolling. This means a horizontally scrolling adapter-based view (like a _TwoWayView_) can also be replaced effortlessly. After adding an _android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView_ to the layout, the next step is to figure out which LayoutManager to use:

*   ListView or ExpandableListView - [LinearLayoutManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/LinearLayoutManager.html)
*   GridView - [GridLayoutManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/GridLayoutManager.html)
*   StaggeredGridView - [StaggeredGridLayoutManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/StaggeredGridLayoutManager.html)
Tip: the setHasFixedSize(true) method on the RecyclerView instance improves performance if the adapter content doesn't change the size of the RecyclerView itself.

### BaseAdapter vs RecyclerView.Adapter

Instead of a BaseAdapter or a BaseExpandableAdapter, you'll have to subclass the RecyclerView.Adapter subclass. Both have a similar approach, but the former enforces the use of ViewHolders, and the mandatory functions are also a bit different. Since we're moving from a Base(Expandable)Adapter to a [RecyclerView.Adapter](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.Adapter.html), let's take a look at the required methods and how to move them!

The method _getCount()_ is equivalent to _getItemCount()_, required in both adapters.

The function getItemID(int position) mandatory in a BaseAdapter is not required in a RecyclerView.Adapter, but it's possible to override it optionally. No modification required here.

There's no equivalent to BaseAdapter's getItem(int position) in RecyclerView.Adapter. If it is necessary, a public method with the same parameters and body works like a charm.

In a Base(Expandable)Adapter, the getView() method is responsible for recycling, setting up the ViewHolder if necessary, and setting data for the current element. This is broken into two functions in a RecyclerView.Adapter: onCreateViewHolder() creates the ViewHolder, while onBindViewHolder() attaches data to the view. The good news is there's no need to manually take care of recycling anymore.

**The ViewHolder pattern**  
There's a good chance that everyone concerned about performance already uses the ViewHolder pattern, but with RecyclerView, you don't have a choice not to. It's a mystery why did Google wait so long to enforce the use of the VH pattern, since it has been around for ages.

### Handling clicks

There's no way of attaching an OnItemClickListener or an OnLongClickListener to a RecyclerView, the adapter has to take care of clicks. This can be done by for example setting an OnClickListener to each item, or by setting one for each ViewHolder, with a properly set position indicator, or other kind of data as class variable.

{% highlight java %}
public static class ViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {
    public View view;
    public Item currentItem;

    public ViewHolder(View v) {
        super(v);
        view = v;
        view.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override public void onClick(View v) {
                //...
            }
        });
    }
}

@Override public void onBindViewHolder(ViewHolder viewHolder, int i) {
    // bind data to the VH
    //...
    // set the current item
    viewHolder.currentItem = items.get(i);
}
{% endhighlight %}

It's also possible to set an onTouchListener on the RecyclerView itself, and figure out which item is selected with findChildViewUnder(float x, float y).

The code should be working now. [This gist](https://gist.github.com/andraskindler/1a57074c1d41908d5261) illustrates the transition. In the following sections, we'll review the most common _extras_ used on adapter-based views.

### ViewType handling

Using item types with a RecyclerView is almost the same as before. The _getItemViewType(int position_) function takes care of mapping positions to types, but there's no need of implementing a _getViewTypeCount()_ function. The adapter will pass the proper ViewHolder in _onBindViewHolder()_, however you'll have to take care of creating all used types in _onCreateViewHolder()_, where the second parameter indicates the ViewType.

### Dividers and padding

These require a bit more work than calling the _setDivider()_ and _setDividerHeight()_ functions, you'll have to use a RecyclerView.ItemDecoration() subclass. If you only want padding between the items, just override the getItemOffsets() method by increasing the proper coordinates of the outRect param. For example for a vertical ListView:

{% highlight java %}
public class DividerItemDecoration extends RecyclerView.ItemDecoration {
    private int padding;

    public DividerItemDecoration(int padding) {
        this.padding = padding;
    }

    @Override public void getItemOffsets(Rect outRect, View view, RecyclerView parent, RecyclerView.State state) {
        outRect.left += padding;
        outRect.right += padding;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

A horizontal would mean the left and right parameters, while using a grid would means all four sides.

Using drawables as dividers is also possible, see [this example](https://chromium.googlesource.com/android_tools/+/18728e9dd5dd66d4f5edf1b792e77e2b544a1cb0/sdk/extras/android/support/samples/Support7Demos/src/com/example/android/supportv7/widget/decorator/DividerItemDecoration.java) from the support library demos.

### Headers

Doing headers is easy, they can be substituted with an extra ViewType.

**Sticky headers**  
This is available as a [third-party library](https://github.com/timehop/sticky-headers-recyclerview) by Timehop.

### SwipeRefreshLayout

The [SwipeRefreshLayout](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/widget/SwipeRefreshLayout.html) is a good thing to have if the adapter can be refreshed. The good news is that it can be used as usual, check out [this tutorial](http://andraskindler.com/2013/playing-around-with-the-swiperefreshlayout/) for more.

### Item animations

ListViews don't support item animations out of the box, but they can be achieved with quite a bit of hacking. The good news is that this became much easier with the [RecyclerView.ItemAnimator](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.ItemAnimator.html), with methods for adding, removing, changing and moving items.

### Other properties

Managing the scrollbars, the overscrollmode and fading the edges have the same methods as before. Highlighting items on click can be done the same way as before, with a custom background drawable.

### Wrapping up

The transition to a RecyclerView requires some effort, but it's worth it - the result is much more flexible and powerful. Hopefully this guide will be helpful, and again, check out the sample code at [this gist](https://gist.github.com/andraskindler/1a57074c1d41908d5261).
